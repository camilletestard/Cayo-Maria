ANALYSIS AND INTERPRETATION ISSUES

1. Modelling p(Acc) and p(Social):
- Removed IDs with too few observations (20)

- When looking at individual probabilities box plots, group V shows an increase in 
p(Acc) post-hurricane (albeit smaller than KK). However when running V only models,
isPost parameter is negative, indicating a decrease in p(Acc) post-hurricane.
	- One potential explanation is that the p(Acc) in the boxplots are agnostic
	to the number of observations per individual. 
- If remove focalID as a random effect, than the isPost parameter becomes positive! 
- In group V if I compute the probability over the entire population pre and post, there is an increase.
	If I compute prob for each individual, there are only 5 individuals with a decrease in prob.
	YET i still get a negative isPost parameter.
	If I remove all individuals that show a decrease in proxiimity rates, I STILL GET A NEGATIVE
	PARAMETER VALUE!!!  
SOLVED: age changes with hurricane, potentially cuking up the variability. If remove age, model is showing 
coherent values. I will set age and rank at the time of hurricane!! 

- In Male only model parameter values, there is a strange bi-modal distribution 
overlapping with zero. 
	- When looking at the frequency of proximity occurrence, 
	it is more than a 2.5-fold increase pre-to-post whether isPost parameter is 1.0 or <0.2
	- However all other parameters suck up all the explanatory power. I.e., when isPost 
	has a large value, all other parameters have a small value and vice-versa.
	- If I remove ID as a random factor, there is no longer that bump around 0.Same if i remove 
	age factor (after reinstating ID RF).However if I remove group, the bump around 0 remains.


2. Computing Network Density and Equity:
- Gini decreases with density in random networks (i.e. equity increases with network density).
 How do I account for that?
Possible solution: dividing observed network Gini coeff by a "null" value, which is the
mean Gini for a random network of similar density.
Note: in this case I am not comparing network equity pre- to post- directly, but rather comparing
how different they are from a baseline.
SOLVED: We decided to exclude network equity from the analysis as network equity is largely determined
by network density


3. Computing partner preference: 
- Occurrence of FF, MM and cross pairs will increase with density. 
How do I account for that?
- Same issue with CK, DK, and U kinship relationship.
--> How do I answer the question: the balance of FF interaction to other types of 
interactions has changed post-hurricane?
Possible solution: Compare observed weighted ratio to expected weighted ratio given the network
Sex pairs: 
	Weighted Observed ratio = [Count X pair]*sum(weights of Xpairs)
	Weighted Expected ratio = [All possible X pair]/[All possible pairs] * sum(weights)
Kinship pairs: 
	Weighted Observed ratio = [Count X pair]*sum(weights of Xpairs)
	Weighted Expected ratio = [# X pairs in the V&KK females]/[All possible Fpairs in V&KK] * sum(weights)
Note: again, I am not comparing partner preference pre- to post- directly.
SUGGESTION: What about using chi-square test of contigency table (Observed-Expected)^2/Expected.


4. Computing social capital: GroomIN, GroomOut, AggIN, AggOUT, sdb.ra, vig.ra
- When computing change in prox and groom rates, some individuals have way more observations 
than others (although it is the same pre-/post-hurricane). Should I account for that somehow?
- Which aggression metric should be considered?
- Weight for aggression network. How do you consider interaction partners of the focal?
  adlib observations?
	There are only 70/~1200 observations that are adlib. 
	Thus, for now, I will add them all together and divide by the # hours followed
- There are some individuals in meta-data file (i.e. focal follow list) that do not have 
grooming or aggression data. Is that possible?


5. Modelling social capital impact on change in sociality rates: 
- GroupV has a negative parameter although there is a larger increase in groupV for dpSoc 
when plotting it!
SOLVED: This seems to be due to the effect across years. When including year as a factor rather than int.
- groupV 2017 has no individual with more than 20 observations! 
- In 2017, vigilance rates and group cannot be disantangled because of high multicolinearity. So i remove group. 

FURTHER ANALYSES: 
How can I get more granular is establishing how social relationships changed post-hurricane?
- Are individuals spending more time with established partners or creating new social bonds?
- How has the balance of Sex partnerships and kin partnerships changed pre-to-post hurricane?
- Aggression data?
